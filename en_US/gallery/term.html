### So you want to use the command line

Your newly started version of Sugar does not include the Terminal Activity in the favorites wheel.

Put another way the Terminal Activity is partially hidden from "first time users".

--

Terminal Activity can be opened from the F3, Home view, **_List view_**, or you can expose it in Favorites view, as described here.

--

Press the function key F3, or Home view key ![](./images/F3zoom_.png).

---

At top right of Home view, Favorites, click **List view**.
