# Four sources of help in Sugar

Activity Help

Help Activity will be found on the Home view.

Press ![](./images/F3zoom_.png) to go to the Home view.

### 4. Social Help

Post questions on an open forum for developers or other users to answer.

Social Help is new for Sugar 0.106, late 2015, don't be shy, please be one of the first to ask!

One of the Social Help categories, Terminal.
