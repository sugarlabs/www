  <h2>About Sugar Labs</h2>
  <p>
    Sugar LabsÂ® is a US-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with a global
    mission to create educational opportunities in technology to youth around
    the world. Volunteer mentors and contributors work together to develop
    activity-focused software for children. All software is developed with
    learning as the primary goal, necessitating the need for source code to be
    published publicly for study, licensed under a Free/Libre license for
    explicit permission to share and remix, and openly worked upon within a
    community where students are invited to make contributions, under guidance
    of experienced mentors. Donations to support the work of Sugar Labs can be
    made at
