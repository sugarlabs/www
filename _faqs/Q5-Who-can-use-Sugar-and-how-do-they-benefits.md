question: "Who can use Sugar and how do they benefit?"
answer: "Sugar is a free software project, freely available to anyone who wants to use it or improve upon it.
 The Sugar platform was designed for young children (Kâ€“6), but it is finding applicability in a number of different venues where the simplicity of design maps is an enabler, e.g., mobile applications, the elderly, etc.
 Sugar will engage even the youngest learner in the use of computation as a powerful 'thing to think with.' They will quickly become proficient in using the computer as a tool to engage in authentic problem-solving. Sugar users develop skills that help them in all aspects of life."
