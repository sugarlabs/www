question: "What makes Sugar different from other educational software platforms?"
answer: "The Sugar interface, in its departure from the desktop metaphor for computing, is the first serious attempt to create a user interface that is based on both cognitive and social constructivism: learners should engage in authentic exploration and collaboration.
 It is based on three very simple principles about what makes us human:
  (1) everyone is a teacher and a learner.
  (2) humans by their nature are social beings.
  (3) humans by their nature are expressive.
 These are the pillars of a user experience for learning."
