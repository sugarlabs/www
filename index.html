  <p>At Sugar Labs, we make a collection of tools that learners
  use to explore, discover, create, and reflect.
  We are non-profit and led by volunteers.
  We distribute these tools freely and encourage our users to
  appropriate them, taking ownership and responsibility for their
  learning.</p>

  <p class="from-white">Sugar is both a desktop and a collection of Activities.
  Activities, as the name implies, are Apps that involve active
  engagement from the learner. Activities automatically save
  results to a journal, where reflections are recorded. Activity
  instances can be shared between learners; many support real-time
  collaboration.</p>

  <img class="toolbar-border" src="assets/neighbourhood-screenshot.svg">
  <p class="from-toolbar">In the Sugar Neighborhood view, learners see their
  friends clustered around their current Activities; from this view they can
  join each other’s Activities.  Sugar collaboration works "peer to
  peer," in a classroom or under a tree; Sugar does not require the
  Internet.</p>

  <img src="assets/journal-detail-ss.png">
  <p class="from-white">The Sugar Journal records everything a learner does
  using Sugar. There is no need to remember to click a Save Button. The focus is on
  the activity, not the computer. The Journal is also a place for
  reflection, where learners and their teachers can monitor progress.</p>
