For example, is this page dedicated to Sugar as desktop environment, or do we want to make this broader to include web apps, Sugarizer, etc.-->

                                <li  class="listFont" >Sugar facilitates sharing and collaboration: children can write articles,
                                share books, or make music together with a single mouse-click.</li>
                                <li class="listFont">Activities, not applications: Sugar activities are applicable
                                beyond the scope of the classroom and even Sugar itself.</li>
                                <li class="listFont">Automatic backup of Activity work; no worrying about files or
                                folders. Sugar’s Journal makes it almost impossible to lose any
                                data.</li>
                                <li class="listFont">The Journal records everything you do: it is a place to reflect
                                upon and evaluate your work.</li>
                                <li class="listFont">Sugar runs on most computer hardware, including slower machines.</li>
                                <li class="listFont">Sugar is Free (Libre) Software: it is written in the Python
                                language and easily customized.</li>
                                <li class="listFont">Sugar is documented by its users: it is easy to use, and teachers
                                worldwide have created a wealth of pedagogical materials for it.</li>
                                <li class="listFont">Sugar is written by its users: 50% of the updates to our latest
                                release came directly from our users.</li><!--It would be nice to have a link here, for reference. -->

                                <li class="listFont">At Sugar Labs, we strive for a <i>learning-centric</i> approach, where teachers mentor students as they engage with powerful ideas, or <em>instructing less and learning more</em>. At Sugar Labs, we give children access to <i>knowledge</i>—through media such as electronic books, the world-wide web, and multimedia—but, more importantly, we give them the tools they need to <i>create</i>, to learn about learning, to put knowledge to use, and engage in reflection and critical dialog. With Sugar, we help learners <i>acquire knowledge</i> so that they grow as active consumers, critics, and <i>creators of knowledge</i>; Sugar welcomes them as members of a vibrant learning community. Plus, cross-community collaboration between technologists and teachers ensures that the ideals of student empowerment, freedom, sharing, open critique, and transparency will remain an integral part of Sugar—one that touches the lives of children and their communities all across the world’s classrooms.</li>
