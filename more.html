                                <li  class="listFont" >Sugar facilitates sharing and collaboration: Children can write,
                                share books, or make music together with a single mouse-click.</li>
                                <li class="listFont">Activities, not applications: Sugar activities are applicable
                                beyond the scope of the classroom and even Sugar itself.</li>
                                <li class="listFont">Automatic backup of Activity work; no worrying about files or
                                folders. Sugar’s Journal makes it almost impossible to lose any
                                data.</li>
                                <li class="listFont">The Journal records everything you do: It is a place to reflect
                                upon and evaluate your work.</li>

                                <li class="listFont">Sugar is documented by its users: It is easy to use and teachers
                                worldwide have created a wealth of pedagogical materials for it.</li>

                                <li class="listFont">At Sugar Labs, we strive for a “learning-centric” approach, where teachers mentor students as they engage with powerful ideas, “teaching less and learning more.” While we want to give children access to knowledge—through media such as electronic books, the world-wide web, and multimedia—we also want them to acquire this knowledge by putting it to use and engaging in critical dialog. With Sugar, we help learners acquire knowledge by giving them tools that make them consumers, critics, and creators of knowledge; Sugar welcomes them as members of a learning community. Cross-community collaboration between technologists and teachers ensures that the ideals of freedom, sharing, open critique, and transparency will be part of the interface to learning that touches children in the world’s classrooms.</li>
