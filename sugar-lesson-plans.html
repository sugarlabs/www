                <h3>Lesson Plan 2</h3>
                <hr>
                <p class="customParagraphStyle2">This lesson plan will target students of any age. 
                <br>
                In the lesson, we will learn how to use Browse activity. This activity will help students learn about internet and get started using internet.
                </p>
                <h4><b>Browse Activity</b></h4>
                <p class="customParagraphStyle2">
                Browse is a simple activity which helps surfing the internet. In other way, it is just a simple but a good web browser. Browse sports some good amount of features.
                Follow the steps to know how to use the Browse activity.
                </p>
                <ol class=" customMargin2">
                    <li class="justifyAlign"><b>First of all open Browse activity from home. (It will be a globe like icon.)</b>
                    <br>
                    After opening you will know that Browse is easy to use. The style is simple.
                    You will see different types of buttons like navigation buttons and more buttons.
                    </li><br/>
                    <li class="justifyAlign"><b>Now how to search?</b>
                    <br>
                    Just type anything in the text box you want to search and it will display the results you want to see. By default, the search engine is Google, so you can use google directly. If you want to type an URL, then just type out the URL there like (www.google.com).
                    </li><br/>
                    <li class="justifyAlign"><b>The Navigation buttons and bookmarking.</b>
                    <br>
                    You can navigate between pages with the help of given buttons. You can use the "Back" button (or CTRL+LEFT) to go to previous page or go forward with the "Forward" button (CTRL+RIGHT). Home button is used to get back to your home page just by a click. You can bookmark any page by clicking on "star" icon so you can access them later just by clicking.
                    </li><br/>
                    <li class="justifyAlign"><b>Undo, Redo, Copy and Paste!</b>
                    <br>
                    You can of course copy text in Sugar. Now, if you want to copy a specific test from a page, you will need to select/mark that text, hover over the "scissor" icon and press the copy button. Paste is also similar to it. You can also use the undo and redo buttons to revert back to your changes. 
                    </li><br/>
                    <li class="justifyAlign"><b>You can also zoom-in, zoom out, and view page in full screen. If you have bookmarked any page you can also choose to show bookmarks tray or not.</b>
                    </li> <br/>
                    <li class="justifyAlign"><b>Journal and Developer tools.</b>
                    <br>
                    You can save your current activity to Journal by clicking on the "diary" icon, giving it name and description. You can make this private or share it with others. By clicking on the "gear" icon, it will open developer tools (only intended for developers).
                    <br/>
                    By this activity, students will know basics about internet, like how to search, get information, search for a specific article. Students will get to know internet better by using Browse.
