## Aims

* to announce our vision and mission,
* to invite potential users of Sugar Labs software,
* to advertise our free software and licensing approach,
* to provide links to software downloads, and;
* to invite potential developers to the source code we hold in trust.

## Contributing

Content on the site; that is information about Sugar, Sugarizer, or Music Blocks, is _way more important_ than the style or appearance.

Please concentrate on updating the content of the site, and not the style or appearance.

For your pull requests or issues to be taken seriously, you must be a user or developer of one of our software products; Sugar, Sugarizer, or Music Blocks.

## History

The site was redesigned during Google Summer of Code in 2017, and then informally reviewed by untainted readers in Google Code-in 2017.  Many issues were created then, but most did not have consensus.  Most of the issues addressed style and appearance rather than the relevance or accuracy of the content.  Since then, we have decided to concentrate on keeping the content updated.

# GSOC 2017 redesigned "www.sugarlabs.org"

These notes were part of a project that has since been merged.

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the redesigned version of "www.sugarlabs.org". This repository code base was used for the development of the GSOC 2017 project **Giving Sugar Labs Website a New Look** under the organization **Sugar Labs**. The changes, made by Pericherla Seetarama Raju and overseen by Samson Goddy, Hrishi Patel, and Walter Bender during the 2017 **GSOC** period, can be viewed at [https://github.com/sugarlabs/www-sugarlabs/issues/63](https://github.com/sugarlabs/www-sugarlabs/issues/63). The work during **GSOC** was done in the repository [https://github.com/geekrypter/sugarLabsWebsiteRedesign](https://github.com/geekrypter/sugarLabsWebsiteRedesign). A live preview of the website is hosted using **Github pages** and can be viewed at [https://geekrypter.github.io/sugarLabsWebsiteRedesign/](https://geekrypter.github.io/sugarLabsWebsiteRedesign/). The code uses the same Jekyll environment as that of the original website's code. Do check out the code!

### Major Services
We have integrated 4 major features with the help of third party services:
1. Website users tracking - We have used the [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) service to track users on the website and get a more detailed analysis of the user's usage.
3. Newsletter subscription through email - We have used the [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com) service to let users subscribe to our newsletters through their emails.
4. Customized search functionality - We have used [Google custom search engine](https://www.google.co.in/cse) to provide a customized search for users.

### Feedback/Suggestions and Issues
Feedback/Suggestions are always welcome and do mention any issues found. They can be provided through the Issues section of this repository

### Code and Contribution
The code has been restructured, unnecessary code has been removed, comments were added wherever required, proper indentation was provided, and simple names were used which makes it a contributor-friendly codebase. So, hope on and contribute now!

## How to run the code
### Getting the code

1. Fork this Repository.

2. Clone your forked copy of the project.
```
git clone https://github.com/<your_user_name>/www-sugarlabs.git
```
3. Navigate to the project directory üìÅ.
```
cd www-sugarlabs
```

### Installation
Install Ruby and the Gem package manager (pre-installed in Mac OS X) and install `jekyll` and its related packages available in the Github hosted version by running, from this directory:

    bundle install;
### Running
Jekyll can run a local web server that rebuilds each time you save a page while editing (Execute the below command from root directory):

    bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental;

Then open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
### Note
If some changes are not visible (after saving a page while editing), please restart the Jekyll local web server and reload [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

## Important points to be noted

1. Whenever the code is changed, please ensure that the relevant code changes are reflected in **main.js** file (For example, if a slideshow is disabled, make sure the id of the slideshow element/section is also disabled in the **main.js** file if it exists).
2. Few dependencies/libraries do not work well with other dependencies/libraries, so make sure to test before updating the dependencies/libraries.
3. Whenever the website hosting is shifted to another url/domain, please ensure to change the internal url references and also the **sitemap.txt** file.
4. Do check **Answers to a few questions** section to get answers to a few of the questions you might have or for steps to be followed.
5. Be careful when changing the cache control code present in the **.htaccess** file.
6. Whenever the dependency/library versions are changed, please update the local files of those dependencies as these local files are referenced when the cdn does not work.
7. The current website uses customized versions of a few social media icons (service provided by [Ion Icons](https://ionicons.com)). We do our customizations in a scss file (**/css/ion_icon_customization.scss** file in our case). Please be careful when updating this file. (Also refer to **How to change social media icon colors?** the subsection in **Answers to few questions** section)

## Some Developer Notes
All internal URLs are referenced through absolute paths and not relative paths. This website primaritally uses HTML, (S)CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Bootstrap.

### Navigation bar / Header
We have 3 header designs based on the screen sizes:
1. header for screen sizes greater than 1260px
2. header for (screen sizes greater than or equal to 768px and  less than or equal to 1260px)
3. header for screen sizes less than 768px

### Logo
We render 2 types of logos displayed in the header:
1. Dynamic logo
2. Static logo
#### Dynamic logo
This is a svg version of **Sugar Labs** logo and we have a code snippet in **main.js** file to alter the svg code and change color of logo randomly everytime.
#### Static logo
This is the png version of **Sugar Labs** logo with no color changing functionality.

The dynamic logo is enabled for:
1. Safari
2. Chrome
3. Opera
4. Firefox
5. Edge
6. Small devices browsers like on Android|BlackBerry|iPhone|iPad|iPod|Opera Mini|IEMobile
#### Note
However due to several issues, I disabled the dynamic logo and rendered static logo for all the other browsers.

### Disabling
For other browsers apart from those mentioned below, the loader, dynamic logo are disabled.
1. Safari
2. Chrome
3. Opera
4. Firefox
5. Edge
6. Internet Explorer
7. Small devices browsers like on Android|BlackBerry|iPhone|iPad|iPod|Opera Mini|IEMobile
#### Note
The dynamic logo is also disabled for Internet Explorer.

### Loader
The loader screen is enabled for:
1. Safari
2. Chrome
3. Opera
4. Firefox
5. Edge
6. Internet Explorer
7. Small devices browsers like on Android|BlackBerry|iPhone|iPad|iPod|Opera Mini|IEMobile
#### Note
To reduce animations, we disabled the loader for all the other browsers.

### Font:
The font being used is the Google font, Varela round. When we call the font sheet directly, it is not properly rendered on certain browsers, so we hosted the required font sheets in the **fonts** folder itself. For more details, please refer to  **How to add/change the new font?** the subsection in the **Answers to a few questions** section.
