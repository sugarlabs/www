                        <p class="customFontSize">Despite the fact
                        that computers, and the software on those
                        computers, run the way much of the world
                        works, there still remains very little support
                        in education, especially at the levels of
                        primary and secondary schooling, to cultivate
                        a computationally literate society. Despite
                        initiatives, a mere “day of code,” sometimes
                        as little as “an hour of code,” is woefully
                        insufficient to instill computational literacy
                        in a generation of young learners, especially
                        when those youth will be living in a world
                        where their social, financial, and democratic
                        interactions & participation is proxied via
                        software, algorithms, and, now, large language
                        models.</p>
			<p>Sugar Labs, as an organization, and the
			suite of apps, curriculum, rubrics, and
			mentoring, is well poised to bridge the gap
			for many learners in the US and around the
			world – the gap between educational services
			provided and what youth need developmentally
			to succeed.</p><!-- Text taken from https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EU4fI_e18DHgx2N2vBMGxBJ-fxiCo0wX-sCtGS3k9fM/edit?tab=t.0 -->

                        <h2>Our History</h2>
                        <p class="customFontSize">The Sugar education
                        initiative began at One Laptop per Child
                        (OLPC), a non-profit initiative with the
                        mission of transforming education for children
                        around the world; this mission was to be
                        achieved by creating and distributing
                        educational devices for the developing world,
                        and by creating software and content for those
                        devices. Sugar was, and still is, the
                        community of teachers and learners working
                        together to create software and curriculum for
                        the OLPC laptop.</p>
			<p>The pedagogical foundations of Sugar come
                        from a long history of educational
                        research. Sugar is a direct descendant of
                        Logo, originally developed by Seymour Papert,
                        Cynthia Solomon, and Wally Feurzeig, and the
                        work of prestigious educators such as Alan
                        Kay, Marvin Minsky, Edith Ackerman, Idit
                        Harel, John Dewey, Jean Piaget, and Lev
                        Vygotsky, among others, also influenced the
                        design. In this vein, Sugar Labs developers
                        continue to interact with educational
                        researchers to maintain the highest quality
                        learning experience.</p>
			<p>The development of Sugar began in 2005 when
			Walter Bender—then executive director of the
			Media Lab and a member of the original OLPC
			team—began a software initiative specifically
			aimed at creating educational software for
			OLPC laptops. At the time, there were no
			student contributors to Sugar, but the
			software and community was designed with their
			future contributions in mind. Now,
			approximately 10 percent of all Sugar
			activities have been written by preteen-age
			children!</p>
			<p>How is it possible that young children are
			able to create activities to be used by
			others? Because development is done in an
			open, transparent manner, it welcomes students
			to learn. Students may start as users of a
			learning tool, but as their curiosity grows
			they are invited to download the source code
			of the tool(s) used. The student can read and
			study the very same source code created by the
			developers (who are teachers and mentors). By
			studying this source code, and asking
			questions to mentors in the community,
			students deepen their understanding of how the
			tools work. In time, these students build a
			solid foundation of knowledge they can use to
			do more sophisticated things.</p>
			<p>Since most of the world that today’s
			children live in technologically-speaking is
			aimed at cultivating consumers, not
			contributors, we believe passionately that our
			paradigm is critically important today. If the
			world is to have citizens who are literate and
			empowered with their technology, we need to
			raise them in a paradigm such as we have Sugar
			Labs. Above all, Sugar Labs empowers teachers
			and learners with tools and knowledge in a
			community where it is fun, safe, and effective
			to do so.</p>
