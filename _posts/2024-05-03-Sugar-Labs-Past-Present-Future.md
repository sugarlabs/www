## About Sugar Labs

Sugar LabsÂ® is a US-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with a
global mission to create educational opportunities in technology to
youth around the world. Volunteer mentors and contributors work
together to develop activity-focused software for children. All
software is developed with learning as the primary goal, necessitating
the need for source code to be published publicly for study, licensed
under a Free/Libre license for explicit permission to share and remix,
and openly worked upon within a community where students are invited
to make contributions, under guidance of experienced mentors.
Donations to support the work of Sugar Labs can be made at
