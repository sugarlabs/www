### Devin Ulibarri: How Sugar Labs empowers education via FLOSS

director Devin Ulibarri, asking him about our key projects, our
free/libre/open (FLO) philosophy, our challenges, and our future
goals. Read the interview to learn more about the trajectory of Sugar
Labs, and share the article to help us reach new people to “expand our
mentoring community and grow our team to support diverse stakeholders”
as Ulibarri describes in the interview.

### Enhancing Sampler widget with drag and drop

*March 6, 2025 by Harshit Verma*

Read about recent enhancements to the sampler widget, implemented by
new contributor Harshit Verma. These enhancements allow users to drag
and drop sound samples into the browser to create code, which is
expected to make using custom samples in Music Blocks more accessible
to users.

### Sugar Labs is a mentoring organization for GSoC 2025

### Two new ways to donate: Every.org and Benevity

*February 26, 2025*

Sugar Labs has recently expanded the ways to donate in support of its
mission. Financial contributions can now be made through every.org, a
fundraising platform that is itself a nonprofit
organization. Every.org accepts donations in many forms, such as
credit card, ACH, stocks, PayPal, and crypto-currency donations. Plus,
every.org doesn't charge a service fee, instead it gives the option to
donate to their nonprofit.

In addition to every.org, donors may now give to Sugar Labs through
Benevity, a Canadian-based firm that supports companies in managing
their employees' charitable giving.

As a US-based nonprofit organization, Sugar Labs is dedicated to
creating Constructionist software and experiences for learners in the
US and all around the world.

## (Volunteer) Help wanted

Sugar Labs is seeking volunteer assistance in the following
ways. Sustained, committed help in any of the following areas will
help us grow as an organization. If you are passionate or curious to
learn more about any of these roles, and are able to commit the time
necessary, then we encourage you to apply. Send a notification of your
interest to info@sugarlabs.org, including some information about
yourself, what interests you about the volunteer role, and what
experience/qualities make you a good candidate for the position.

Sugar Labs is a growing organization. We don't currently have the
resources to hire people to fulfill these roles. Our hope is that we
one day will be able to, but, for now, we are looking for volunteers
who can work with the executive director and the board to work
diligently to improve our operations. What we can provide, in return,
for your help, is assistance in conducting your role and mentorship
(especially in the case of technical roles). Plus, you'll gain the
experience and satisfaction of working with an organization that aims
to do good in society.
