*Recent news for December 29, 2024*

Welcome to the second issue of the "Sweet Spot", a newsletter for
Sugar Labs-related news in development, student and teacher work,
events, how to get involved, and other news and information. This
newsletter will be published semi-regularly for now, but the plan is
to publish it on a bi-monthly, perhaps even monthly, basis in the
future. Our aim with this newsletter is to help keep the growing body
of Sugar Labs contributors on the same page, all while documenting our
growth for our own and others' reference.

These first issues are meant to set a precedent of communication and
documentation, as well as to help inform the community of our current
status, recent progress, and future plans. Its predecessor is the
[“Sugar Digest”][1], which still serves as an important catalog of our
activities. Like Sugar Digest, this newsletter is intended to keep
community members in the loop about everything going on within Sugar
Labs. It will highlight any recent publications from us. It will
occasionally include links to third-party news and updates that our
community finds relevant.

ways.</figcaption></figure>

Sugar Labs is in the middle of a campaign to raise funds necessary for
outreach, software development, project maintenance, mentorship, and
more. Having left Software Freedom Conservancy in 2020, this year is
the first that Sugar Labs is investing financially in its own growth,
and we’d love to have your participation in this pivotal moment. We’ve
been particularly heartened to see volunteers in our community assist
with various aspects of this campaign, such as making improvements to
our website. You may also participate in our fundraiser, while getting
something nice for yourself or a loved one, by purchasing Sugar Labs
merchandise from our new store on Bonfire.

Read executive director Devin Ulibarri’s letter to the community to
learn more about the work we’ve done this year, consider making a
donation or purchasing merchandise, and please help spread the word.

### Reflections from Constructing Modern Knowledge 2024

*November 27, 2024*

This past July, Sugar Labs executive director and Music Blocks
co-maintainer Devin Ulibarri attended Constructing Modern Knowledge
(CMK). In this post, Ulibarri shares his experience at the teacher
institute, what he learned, and what it could mean for Sugar Labs. He
also shares his group’s “Lego Notation for the Blind” project, which
is a step toward using physical Lego blocks as musical notation to
convert to a programming language such as Sugar Labs’s Music
Blocks. By taking Lego blocks, configured pitch-over-time on a
baseplate, a camera connected to a computer can image the Legos and
translate them into musical code. While the system is not yet
complete, the article gives insight into what Music Blocks can do, how
Sugar Labs is approaching outreach (as well as learning from other
educators), and a glimpse at what we’re looking to create in the
future.

### James Simmons’s Sugar Story: Writing new Activities and sharing Sugar with youth

*September 3, 2024*

Sugar Labs community member James Simmons shares his story about his
involvement with Sugar Labs. Simmons tells us how he began
contributing to the Sugar Learning Platform by expanding the
functionality of the Read Activity and adding support for e-texts. In
addition to authoring Read ETexts, he also created View Slides and
Read SD Comics Activities to support the ability to read comic books
in CBZ format. Having had this experience writing Activities for
Sugar, he wrote *Make Your Own Sugar Activities\!* as a manual for
anyone interested in writing their own Activities for Sugar.

## (Volunteer) Help wanted

Sugar Labs is seeking volunteer assistance in the following
ways. Sustained, committed help in any of the following areas will
help us grow as an organization. If you are passionate or curious to
learn more about any of these roles, and are able to commit the time
necessary, then we encourage you to apply. Send a notification of your
interest to info@sugarlabs.org, including some information about
yourself, what interests you about the volunteer role, and what
experience/qualities make you a good candidate for the position.

Sugar Labs is a growing organization. We don't currently have the
resources to hire people to fulfill these roles. Our hope is that we
one day will be able to, but, for now, we are looking for volunteers
who can work with the executive director and the board to work
diligently to improve our operations. What we can provide, in return,
for your help, is assistance in conducting your role and mentorship
(especially in the case of technical roles). Plus, you'll gain the
experience and satisfaction of working with an organization that aims
to do good in society.
