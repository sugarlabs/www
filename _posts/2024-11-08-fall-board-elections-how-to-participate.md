Inc. There are three seats up for election. Two seats are held by
board members Lionel Laské and Alex Perez, and one seat is a vacancy.

There are no special qualifications that you need to prove to be able
to vote.

### Running for a board position

### Election method

After doing research on various [election software recommended by the
FLOSS community](https://github.com/sugarlabs/elections-research), we
have decided to use [bettervoting.com](http://bettervoting.com). The
software is licensed under the AGPLv3, and the system supports
automatic runoff vote tallying. Our internal research on the system
can be found here:
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kuXXL-tVgB1Ptu50cTonWtRnAuKmWn1jyKd1qPgqFJY/edit?tab=t.0>

Again, we encourage you to take the first step and apply for a ballot
via our [application form](https://forms.gle/48F6h5wdV6BpSro66), and
we look forward to your involvement.
