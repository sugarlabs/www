A few times in recent months, we received questions from folks about
how to buy Sugar. Until now, the only response we had was that we
didn't offer them for sale, but that you could [create your own by
following our instructions][1]. If you wanted to [run Sugar on a
Stick][2], you had to flash a USB drive yourself before using it.

Of course, flashing a USB can be a great educational experience, and
this will remain an option. However, what we heard from people asking
this question was that they wanted a few things that they couldn't get
from flashing a USB themselves. One is that they wanted the
convenience—and added assurance–of purchasing a USB from a reputable
vendor. Another is that some people were expecting something branded
with the Sugar Labs logo. For some, it may be the ability to gift a
USB for a friend or teacher. And, for the majority who reached out to
us, it seemed that they wanted a way to pay us for the software, and,
in so doing, help sustain our work for years to come.

We partnered up with USB Memory Direct for this particular
offering. USB Memory Direct (UMD) has a history of supporting
[free/libre/open source projects such as ours][3]. They will also be
handling inventory and shipping & handling, which means that we at
Sugar Labs can keep focusing on what we do best: create learning
software for education! Plus, UMD will give all profits from sales to
Sugar Labs, which we will use to further our mission in
Constructionist education.
