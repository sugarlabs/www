### Eligibility to vote

Since we made [our initial announcement][4], one of the most
frequently asked questions has been *what determines eligibility for
participating in the election?* Participation in the election is open
to any member of Sugar Labs, and the eligibility requirements for
membership are published on
<https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Members>. The main gist,
however, is that you’ve made a contribution to Sugar Labs. According
to our definition, such a contribution “may be code, documentation,
translations, maintenance of project-wide resources, *running a Sugar
deployment*, or other non-trivial activities which benefit Sugar
Labs”.

If you’ve made such a contribution to Sugar Labs, you are eligible as
a member, and, as a member, you may vote. ***Also, if you’re not a
member or unsure about your status, we still encourage you to submit
an application for a ballot.*** We will automatically begin to
determine your membership eligibility based on your publicly visible
contributions, so no other steps are necessary on your part.

### Current members must vote in this election in order to maintain their membership status

If you are receiving this message, it may be because you are currently
considered a member of Sugar Labs according to our most recent
membership list, which may be found here:
<https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Members/List>. If you do not
apply for a ballot to vote in this election, then we will consider
your membership to be rescinded and your membership will be made
inactive. Because [our bylaws require a majority vote from members to
pass certain amendments][5] we need to ensure that our current
membership list is up-to-date with active members. Your email address
will nonetheless remain subscribed to this mailing list unless you
unsubscribe, which you may do at any time by following the
