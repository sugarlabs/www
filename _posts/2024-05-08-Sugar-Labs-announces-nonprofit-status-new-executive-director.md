## Sugar Labs is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit

In 2019, the Sugar Labs oversight board [voted to incorporate as its
own entity][1] and apply for nonprofit status. After that vote, the
members of the board began efforts to leave the [Software Freedom
Conservancy][2], incorporate as Sugar Labs Inc., and applied for 501(c)(3)
nonprofit status. In the spring of 2021, Sugar Labs Inc. was granted
nonprofit status from the IRS.
