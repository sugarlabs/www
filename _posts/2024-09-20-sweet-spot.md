*Recent news for September 20, 2024*

Welcome to the very first issue of the "Sweet Spot", a newsletter for
Sugar Labs-related news in development, student and teacher work,
events, how to get involved, and other news and information. This
newsletter will be published semi-regularly for now, but the plan is
to publish it on a bi-monthly, perhaps even monthly, basis in the
future. Our aim with this newsletter is to help keep the growing body
of Sugar Labs contributors on the same page, all while documenting our
growth for our own and others' reference.

This first issue is meant to set a precedent of communication and
documentation, as well as to help inform the community of our current
status, recent progress, and future plans. Its predecessor is the
[“Sugar Digest”][1], which still serves as an important catalog of our
activities. Like Sugar Digest, this newsletter is intended to keep
community members in the loop about everything going on within Sugar
Labs. It will highlight any recent publications from us. It will
occasionally include links to third-party news and updates that our
community finds relevant.

This first issue has links and “news” from a few months back. Future
installments will focus on a more acute timeframe than this inaugural
issue, which aims to cover our news since the beginning of this year.

We hope that you enjoy this first issue. And, if you have something
you’d like to share, please feel free to email info@sugarlabs.org. And
for those who would like to volunteer in other ways, this edition has
a list of volunteer help that we need with Sugar Labs overall.

## Updates

### Sugar Labs as a nonprofit and ED announcement

In the spring of 2021, Sugar Labs Inc. was granted nonprofit status
from the IRS. In January of this year, Sugar Labs hired its first
employee since becoming a nonprofit. Sugar Labs community member and
Music Blocks co-creator Devin Ulibarri was hired by the Sugar Labs
board of directors to fill the role of full-time executive
director. The members of board of directors for Sugar Labs
Inc. currently are Samson Goddy, Lionel Laské, Claudia Urrea, Walter
Bender, and Alex Perez.

### Ways to get involved

Sugar Labs is seeking volunteer assistance in the following
ways. Sustained, committed help in any of the following areas will
help us grow as an organization. If you are passionate or curious to
learn more about any of these roles, and are able to commit the time
necessary, then we encourage you to apply. Send a notification of your
interest to info@sugarlabs.org, including some information about
yourself, what interests you about the volunteer role, and what
experience/qualities make you a good candidate for the position.

Sugar Labs is a growing organization. We don't currently have the
resources to hire people to fulfill these roles. Our hope is that we
one day will be able to, but, for now, we are looking for volunteers
who can work with the executive director and the board to work
diligently to improve our operations. What we can provide, in return,
for your help, is assistance in conducting your role and mentorship
(especially in the case of technical roles). Plus, you'll gain the
experience and satisfaction of working with an organization that aims
to do good in society.
