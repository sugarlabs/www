The winners are Devin Ulibarri, Sumit Srivastava, and Sebastian
Silva. They have all been notified and have agreed to serve on the
Board of Directors for the 2025-26 cycle. For this election, we used
bettervoting.com after doing research on various voting
systems. Please read our [original election announcement][3] for more
information on how we decided upon this voting system.

The new members of the board will be filling the seats of two outgoing
board members, Lionel Lask√© and Alex Perez, and one vacant seat.

The next election for three seats to the 2026-27 cycle is planned for
August of next year. All Sugar Labs members may vote, and members can
run for election to the Board of Directors, vote in the elections for
the Board of Directors, and suggest referenda. As indicated in the
[Sugar Labs Inc. bylaws][4], anyone with "significant and sustained"
contributions to Sugar Labs is eligible for membership. If you believe
you qualify for membership based on this criteria and are interested
in [becoming an official member of Sugar Labs][5], you are encouraged
to send an email to <members@sugarlabs.org>. And if you were a member
in the past, but [did not vote in this election][6], you will need to
reapply for membership in order for your membership status to be
reinstated. (If you voted in this election, no further action is
required.) Registering for membership early will help ensure that you
will be ready for the next election.
